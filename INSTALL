As this is a small piece of software, we do not provide any configure script
or makefile. This is a header-only library, to make use of it you should copy
the kashmir directory to a location that is visible to your preprocessor and
include the proper header in your code.

kashmir/uuid.h provides a concrete type compliant to RFC 4122. It was a design
decision to make uuid_t resemble a built-in type as much as possible, so the
interface is limited to the comparison operators and test for nil.
