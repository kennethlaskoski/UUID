# UUID
Universally Unique ID - as defined by ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005 (see also [RFC 4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122)

This is an old work of mine that I found at Sourceforge. It's a pretty thorough C++ implementation of UUIDs.
As an aside this includes the first iOS app I ever made. If I have the time, maybe I'll update it to work on my current devices.
