This is the Kashmir Library.

The Kashmir Library is intended to provide functionality needed in many
software projects, but not present in the C++ standard library. It overlaps
with existing C libraries and with the Boost libraries.

The advantage over C libraries is the use of C++ as a tool that supports
principles such as abstraction, encapsulation and decoupling, which were
born to facilitate design and implementation of larger systems.

As for Boost libraries, the difference is more subtle. Boost strives to be as
general as possible, covering the myriad of CPU-OS-Compiler combinations that
are available. On the flip side, we apply the KISS principle, keeping the code
as neat as possible, while still being able to build on Linux and Windows with
the "default" compiler, respectively g++ and VC++.

We provide the source code, you can adapt it to any particular need.
